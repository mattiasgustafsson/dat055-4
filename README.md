## Game scenario:

Post-apocalyptic zombie theme. The player moves in different rooms in a building. From the beginning,
the player is infected with a zombie virus and they do not remember how they got there. 
The player must look for different ingredients and find a cure before it's too late. 
Ingredients are placed in different rooms (randomly selected) and have to be mixed in a special room according to the recipe.
Once the player has blended the cure they must reach the roof of the building to be picked up by a helicopter.
Along their way the player finds aggressive zombies who want to stop them.
