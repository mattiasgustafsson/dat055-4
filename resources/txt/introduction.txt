You are infected by a zombie virus. Youâ€™re running out of time and you need to find a cure before you turn into a zombie. Once you are cured find the exit and get to the chopper!

Look for the recipe and all the ingredients you need! But be careful, there are zombies roaming the grounds. Some of them are relatively harmless but if you come across the wrong one you might be in for a lot of trouble. Equipping armor that you might find lying around will help you by lessening the blow.

If you can find any food to eat, it might give you some extra strength. Be careful, some of the food might be old or make you sick.
